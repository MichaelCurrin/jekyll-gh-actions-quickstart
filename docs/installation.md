# Installation

Set up this project to run locally. On Linux, macOS or Windows.


## Requirements

- _Ruby_ - To install the project-scoped gems, including Jekyll.
- _Bundler_ - Used to manage Ruby gem dependencies in an isolated directory, to preserve your global gems.
- _Make_  - The docs here use the _make_ command, which comes standard on macOS or Linux machine, but on Windows you need to download and install Make. Or, if you go to [Makefile](/Makefile), you can look up the appropriate shell commands to run without `make`.


## Clone

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart.git
$ cd jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart
```

You can view the commands available in the [Makefile](/Makefile) or skip to the next step. Note that `make` only works in macOS or Linux. Thought, it is optional, as you can run commands directly

```sh
$ make help
```


## Install system dependencies

Install Ruby and Bundler globally - follow this [gist](https://gist.github.com/fb758aea4d35e03b9ed093afddf4e7ec).


## Install project dependencies

Install local gems.

```sh
$ make install
```


## Upgrade

Run this command if needed upgrade to the latest gems.

```sh
$ make upgrade
```

When you upgrade, the `Gemfile.lock` file will be updated, if there are any changes. You can commit this to your own repo.
