## GH Pages and GH Actions

- [GitHub Actions](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/ci-cd/github-actions/) resources.
    - Including links to the officials docs and my blog posts own getting started with GH Actions. Plus there are links to my cookbook and cheatsheets so you can learn more about GitHub Actions - solving a variety of cased around Jekyll, Node, Python and more.
- [GitHub Pages](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-resources/resources/web/github-pages.html) resources.
    - For hosting your static website.

I also wrote a tutorial on the Jekyll around using GitHub Actions. So check that out for more info on how this template works. The main difference is that the tutorial uses a Jekyll-specific Action, while this template project uses a more generic flow.
