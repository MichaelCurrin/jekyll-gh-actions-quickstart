But, there are limitations of the GitHub Pages environment - you cannot use Jekyll 4 or non-standard gems (your Gemfile is ignored) and you cannot add Python, Node, Hugo, etc. to your build flow. To overcome these limitations, this template project uses a GitHub Actions workflow. Allowing you to specify Jekyll 4 and other gems you want. And use other steps like compiling assets with Node. ",

That uses some generic Actions, to avoid relying into an over-specialized complex Action that does too much (like many other there that do Ruby, Jekyll, building, and deploying). The generic steps mean it is easy to see exactly what the steps are doing and to modify the flow. Plus, you can reuse the steps for other projects such as deploying a React site to GH Pages. On a commit to the main branch, the CI will do the following: . | Set up the environment. | Build the site. | Commit the build output to the repo’s gh-pages branch. | . Then that output is served as a static site, since GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings. The CI actually will also run on a PR against the main branch too - it will just skip the last part of committing to the gh-pages branch. So you can still use the CI to test your tests and build flow works correctly, without accidentally publishing your feature branch as a deployed site.
