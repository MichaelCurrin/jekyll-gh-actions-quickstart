To overcome these, this template project uses a GitHub Actions workflow. See [main.yml](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) workflow file. On a commit to the main branch, the CI does the following: 1. Setup the environment. 2. Build the site. 3. Commit the build output to the repo's [gh-pages](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart/tree/gh-pages) branch. Then that output is served as a static site, since GitHub Pages is enabled in _Settings_. The CI actually also runs on a PR against the main branch too - it just last skips the part of commiting to the `gh-pages` branch. So you can still use the CI to test your tests and build flow works correctly, without accidentally publishing your feature branch as a deployed site. See [Actions](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart/actions/workflows/main.yml) section on the repo for logs of job runs. The [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme was setup - see the Gemfile and config. You can use any Jekyll theme you want - as long as it is compatiable with Jekyll 4. ## Create your own Get a copy of this template project which you can easily run and host on your GitHub account. 1.

Go to your repo's _Settings_. 1. Enable a GitHub Pages site on the **root** path of the `gh-pages` branch. 1. Go to the _Environment_ section on the right of repo to check the status of the build. 1.

I also wrote a tutorial on the Jekyll around using GitHub Actions. So check that out for more info on how this template works. The main difference is that the tutorial uses a Jekyll-specific action while this template project uses a more generic but easy Ruby-based flow. - [CI/CD - GitHub Actions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/continuous-integration/github-actions/) If you are interested in seeing more Jekyll projects, have a look here.
