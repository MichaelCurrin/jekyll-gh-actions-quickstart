But, to avoid the limitations of the GitHub Pages environment such as no Jekyll 4 or non-standard gems, this template project uses GitHub Actions to build the site. See [main.yml](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml) workflow file. On a commit, the CI runs to setup the environment, build the site and then commit to the [gh-pages](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-gh-actions-quickstart/tree/gh-pages) branch. Then that output is served as static output with GitHub Pages. The [just-the-docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme is setup - see Gemfile and config. You can use any Jekyll theme you want, as long as it is compatiable with Jekyll 4. ## Create your own 1. Click this button.
