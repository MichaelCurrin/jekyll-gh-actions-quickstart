title: Local setup
---

This project is **not** intended to be run locally with a dev server. As the focus on is on content and letting the theme take care of all the appearance and templating concerns.

But, if you **do** want to run this locally, such as for faster debugging and experimenting, I recommend following instructions and setup steps on this project:

It covers installing Ruby, Bundle and project gems locally (including Jekyll). It has a `Gemfile` which you can use to get started. Though, that uses the standard GH Pages and Jekyll 3.9 approach. And also without GH Actions.
