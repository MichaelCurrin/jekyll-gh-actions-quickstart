title: Set up locally

This project is **not** indended to be run locally with a dev server.

But if you **do** want to run it locally, I recommend following instructions and set up steps as on this project.

It covers installing Ruby, Bundle and project gems locally (including Jekyll). It has a `Gemfile` which you can use to get started. Though, that uses the standard GH Pages and Jekyll 3.9 approach. And without GH Actions.
